# Synapis v3.2

### The skill system for Claude Code that learns and adapts to you.

> Stop explaining the same thing twice. Synapis remembers, learns, and gets better with every session.

## What is Synapis?

Synapis is an intelligent skill management system for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). It solves a fundamental problem: **Claude Code forgets everything between sessions.**

Every time you start a new session, Claude starts from zero. Your preferences, your tech stack, your workflows, your past decisions — all gone. You end up repeating yourself. Again. And again.

**Synapis fixes this.** It gives Claude Code:

- **Memory that persists** across sessions and projects
- **Skills that load on demand** instead of all at once
- **A learning engine** that observes what you do and creates reusable patterns
- **A router** that knows which tools you need for each project

Think of it as going from a dumb terminal to an assistant that actually knows you.

---

## The Problem (Before Synapis)

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| All skills loaded every session | ~25,000 tokens wasted before you say a word |
| No memory between sessions | You explain your stack, preferences, and context every time |
| No memory between projects | Decisions in project A don't carry to project B |
| No skill management | 50+ skills compete for attention, most irrelevant |
| No learning | Claude doesn't improve from session to session |

**In short: you do the same work over and over, and Claude never gets smarter.**

---

## The Solution (With Synapis)

| Feature | How it works |
|---------|-------------|
| **Skills on Demand** | Only loads the skills your current project needs (~2,500 tokens vs ~25,000) |
| **Operator State** | Your identity, stack, and decisions persist across ALL projects |
| **Synapsis Engine** | Observes your work silently, detects patterns, creates reusable skills |
| **Skill Router** | Matches your intent to the right skills from a dormant catalog |
| **Passive Rules** | Technical guardrails that fire automatically (security, quality, workflow) |
| **Project Cloning** | Clone a successful project as the base for a new one — skills, structure, and all |

**Result: 90% less token waste. Zero repetition. Claude that actually improves.**

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed
- Git

### Installation

**Step 1: Install the files**

macOS / Linux:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luispitik/synapis.git
cd synapis
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Windows:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Luispitik/synapis.git
cd synapis
install.bat
```

**Step 2: Create your Synapis home folder**

Create a new empty folder anywhere on your computer. This will be your **Synapis control center** — the place where you configure and manage everything.

```bash
mkdir ~/synapis-home
cd ~/synapis-home
claude
```

**Step 3: Let Synapis guide you**

When you open Claude Code in that folder for the first time, Synapis detects it's a fresh install and walks you through everything:

1. Sets up your profile (who you are, what you do)
2. Configures your memory (so it remembers you across projects)
3. Activates automatic protections (security, quality checks)
4. Shows you what you have and how to use it

**After this first session, Synapis propagates to ALL your projects automatically.** You don't need to install anything else — just open Claude Code in any folder and your system is there.

The `synapis-home` folder becomes your go-to place for system management: running `/system-status`, `/evolve`, or updating your global configuration.

---

## What Happens After Install

1. **You open Claude Code** in any project folder
2. **Synapis detects it's your first time** and launches onboarding
3. **It searches for existing context** (prior CLAUDE.md, memory files, git history)
4. **If it finds something**, it shows you: "I found this about you. Correct?"
5. **If not**, it offers two paths:
   - **Quick** — 3 questions, start working in 30 seconds
   - **Complete** — Tell me everything, never repeat yourself again
6. **Your context is saved** in the Operator State — applies to ALL future projects

From that point on, every session starts with Claude already knowing who you are, what you use, and how you work.

## How It Works

### The Session Flow

```
Open Claude Code
       |
       v
  CLAUDE.md loads
  (entry point)
       |
       v
  Read Operator State
  (your identity + decisions)
       |
       v
  Launcher appears:
  [1] Skills on Demand
  [2] Skill Picker (manual)
  [3] Freestyle (vanilla)
       |
       v
  Skill Router matches
  your project to skills
       |
       v
  Install ONLY what
  you need (2,500 tokens
  instead of 25,000)
       |
       v
  You work normally
  Synapsis observes silently
```

### The Learning Loop

```
  You work on your project
         |
         v
  Synapsis detects patterns
  ("You've done this 3 times...")
         |
         v
  Creates an Instinct
  (atomic rule + confidence 0-100%)
         |
         v
  When confidence >= 80%
  /evolve suggests promotion
         |
         v
  You choose: create Skill,
  Command, Agent, Rule, or Skip
         |
         v
  New skill added to catalog
  Available for ALL projects
         |
         v
  Cycle repeats.
  Every session feeds the next.
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/system-status` | Full dashboard: skills, tokens, projects, health |
| `/evolve` | Analyze mature patterns, create skills/rules/commands |
| `/clone` | Clone a project as base for a new one |
| `/skill-audit` | Deep scan of installed skills with cleanup proposals |
| `/passive-status` | Which passive rules fire, which never triggered |
| `/instinct-status` | All learned patterns with confidence scores |
| `/analyze-observations` | Process observation logs, suggest new skills |
| `/promote` | Promote project-specific patterns to global |
| `/projects` | List all known projects with stats |

## Architecture

```
~/.claude/
  CLAUDE.md                  <-- Entry point (loaded every session)
  skills/
    skill-router/            <-- Orchestrator (always active)
    synapis-learning/        <-- Learning engine (always active)
    synapis-instincts/       <-- Knowledge base (always active)
    synapis-researcher/      <-- Deep research (always active)
    synapis-optimizer/       <-- Context optimization (always active)
    _library/                <-- Dormant skills (installed on demand)
    _archived/               <-- Retired skills (recoverable)
    _catalog.json            <-- Skill registry with token estimates
    _passive-rules.json      <-- Automatic guardrails
    _operator-state.json     <-- Your identity + decisions (cross-project)
    _projects.json           <-- Project registry
  commands/                  <-- Slash commands (/evolve, /clone, etc.)
```

### Token Budget

| Component | Tokens | When |
|-----------|--------|------|
| 5 global skills | ~2,700 | Every session |
| Passive rules | ~155 | Every session |
| Operator state | ~200-500 | Every session |
| Project skills | ~500-2,000 | Per project |
| **Total** | **~3,500-5,500** | vs ~25,000 before |

## For Existing Users

Already have skills installed? Run `/skill-audit` after installing Synapis.

It will:
1. Scan all your existing skills and commands
2. Calculate token overhead per skill
3. Detect duplicates and conflicts
4. Propose a cleanup plan with token savings
5. Ask permission before changing anything

**Nothing is deleted without your approval.** Everything archived is recoverable.

---

## FAQ

**Does this work with any Claude Code project?**
Yes. Synapis is project-agnostic. It adapts to whatever you're building.

**Will it slow down Claude?**
The opposite. By reducing token overhead by 90%, Claude has more context for actual work.

**Can I use it without the learning system?**
Yes. Choose [3] Freestyle in the launcher for vanilla Claude Code.

**Can I create my own skills?**
Yes. Use `/evolve` to turn mature patterns into skills, or create them manually in `_library/`.

**Does it work on Windows, Mac, and Linux?**
Yes. Installers for all three platforms included.
